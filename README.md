# Machine-Learning
In this course paper, I had study about the Artificial Intelligence and the focus was in Machine
Learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that allows machines to mimic human behavior.
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows a machine learning model from
prior data without having to design it directly. Decision tree classifier is very important to understand
how to build a training model that can predict the class or value of the target variable. In this paper,
Based on Iris dataset I had study about the decision tree classifier.
